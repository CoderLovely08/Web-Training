        Bamboos are a diverse group of mostly evergreen perennial flowering plants making up the subfamily Bambusoideae
        of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family, in the case of
        Dendrocalamus sinicus individual culms reaching a length of 46 meters, up to 36 centimeters in thickness and a
        weight of up to 450 kilograms.[3] The internodes of bamboos can also be of great length. Kinabaluchloa wrayi has
        internodes up to 2.5 meters in length.[4] and Arthrostylidium schombergkii with lower internodes up to 5 meters
        in length,[5] exceeded in length only by Papyrus. By contrast, the culms of the tiny bamboo Raddiella vanessiae
        of the Kaieteur Plateau in French Guiana are only 10–20 millimeters in length by about two millimeters in
        width.[6][7] The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or Portuguese
        language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.[8]
